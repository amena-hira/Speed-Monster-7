                <h2>Difference between local storage vs session storage.</h2>
                <p><strong class="text-success">Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-success">Session Storage</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.
                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.

                <h2>Difference between global scope vs block scope.</h2>
                <p><strong class="text-success">The Global scope</strong> 

                    A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="text-success">Block Scope</strong> variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                    The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.
                    <strong>ES6 introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords. These two keywords are scoped within the block which are defined.</strong>

                <h2>How event loop work in js?</h2>
                <p>
                    An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded.Here the callback function in the event queue has not yet run and is waiting for its time into the stack when the SetTimeOut() is being executed and the Web API is making the mentioned wait. When the function stack becomes empty, the function gets loaded onto the stack.That is where the event loop comes into picture, it takes the first event from the Event Queue and places it onto the stack i.e in this case the callback function. From here, this function executes calling other functions inside it, if any.This cycle is called the <strong>event loop</strong>  and this how JavaScript manages its events.

                <h2>How many ways to get undefined in js?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value.
                    </li>
                </ol>
